                <p>I have no background in software development and no work experience yet,I just finished year 12 and I decided why not join a software development bootcamp. I've always had interest in technology and I want to try out software development so I can have the basic of it at hand.I'm a dog lover, the love I have for them is unmatched. I also have a kin interest in music, it's calming and I can play piano.</p>
